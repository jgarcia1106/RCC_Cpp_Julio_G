1. Write a program that asks for five test scores. The program should calculate the average

test score and display it. The number displayed should be formatted in fixed-point

notation, with one decimal point of precision.

2. A bag of cookies holds 40 cookies. The calorie information on the bag claims that

there are 10 “servings” in the bag and that a serving equals 300 calories. Write a program

that asks the user to input how many cookies he or she actually ate and then

reports how many total calories were consumed.

3. Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings

for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a

program that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays

the minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.

4. Baby it is hot outside?

Write a program that converts Fahrenheit temperatures to Celsius temperatures. The formula is

C = 5/9(F-32)

F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature

5. Use the trig functions!

Write a program that asks the user for an angle, entered in degrees. The program

should then display the sine, cosine, and tangent of the angle. (Use the sin, cos, and

tan library functions to determine these values.) The output should be displayed in

fixed-point notation, rounded to four decimal places of precision.

6. Calculate the gross pay!

Calculate the gross pay.

Input your pay rate in $'s/hr and the number of hours worked.

Output your gross pay in $'s

You are paid straight time for the first 40 hours, but are paid double time for hours greater than 40.

7. How many cans of diet coke can I consume before losing all my weight? :)

A government research lab has concluded that an artificial sweetener commonly used in diet soda pop will cause death in laboratory mice. A friend of yours is desperate to lose weight but cannot give up soda pop. Your friend wants to know how much diet soda pop it is possible to drink without dying as a result. Write a program to supply the answer. The input to the program is the amount of artificial sweetener needed to kill a mouse (use 5 grams), the mass of the mouse (use 35 grams), and the weight of the dieter (use 45359.2 grams for a 100 pound person). Assume that the lethal dose for a mouse is proportional to the lethal dose for the human. A single can of soda pop has a mass of 350 grams. To ensure the safety of your friend, be sure the program requests the weight at which the dieter will stop dieting, rather than the dieter’s current weight. Assume that diet soda contains 1/10th of 1% artificial sweetener. Use a variable declaration with the modifier const to give a name to this fraction. You may want to express the percent as the float value 0.001f.

Use only the float data type where necessary, no doubles.

Input the users weight, Output the number of cans of soda the user can consume before he/she hits the expiration quantity.

8. Calculate the new compensation

Workers at a particular company have won a 7.6% pay increase retroactive

for 6 months. Write a program that takes an employee’s previous annual

salary as input, and outputs the amount of retroactive pay due the employee,

the new annual salary, and the new monthly salary.

Use 7 character or less variable names.

Use only the size integer variables required.

Use only the float data type where necessary, no doubles.

9. Calculate room occupancy and limits.

Write a program that determines whether a meeting room is in violation

of fire law regulations regarding the maximum room capacity. The program

will read in the maximum room capacity and the number of people

attending the meeting. If the number of people is less than or equal to the

maximum room capacity, the program announces that it is legal to hold

the meeting and tells how many additional people may legally attend. If

the number of people exceeds the maximum room capacity, the program

announces that the meeting cannot be held as planned due to fire regulations

and tells how many people must be excluded in order to meet the

fire regulations.

Use only the size integer variables required.

Use only the float data type where necessary, no doubles.

10. Sum positive, negative and all numbers.

Write a program that reads in ten whole numbers and that outputs the

sum of all the numbers greater than zero, the sum of all the numbers less

than zero (which will be a negative number or zero), and the sum of all

the numbers, whether positive, negative, or zero. The user enters the ten

numbers just once each and the user can enter them in any order. Your

program should not ask the user to enter the positive numbers and the

negative numbers separately.

Use 7 character or less variable names.

Use only the size integer variables required.

Use only the float data type where necessary, no doubles.
