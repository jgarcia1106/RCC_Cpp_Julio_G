1. Sum of Two Numbers  
Write a program that stores the integers 50 and 100 in variables, and stores the sum of these two in a variable named total.  

2. Sales Prediction  
The East Coast sales division of a company generates 58 percent of total sales. Based  on that percentage, write a program that will predict how much the East Coast division  will generate if the company has $8.6 million in sales this year.  

3. Sales Tax  
Write a program that will compute the total sales tax on a $95 purchase. Assume the  state sales tax is 4 percent, and the county sales tax is 2 percent.  

4. Restaurant Bill  
Write a program that computes the tax and tip on a restaurant bill for a patron with  a $88.67 meal charge. The tax should be 6.75 percent of the meal cost. The tip should be 20 percent of the total after adding the tax. Display the meal cost, tax amount, tip  amount, and total bill on the screen.  

5. Average of Values  
To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up then divide the sum by  the number of values. Write a program that stores the following values in five different variables: 28, 32, 37, 24, and 33. The program should first calculate the sum of  these five variables and store the result in a separate variable named sum. Then, the  program should divide the sum variable by 5 to get tbe average. Display the average  on the screen.  
~: TIP: Use the doubl e data type fo r all variables in this program. 

6. Annual Pay  
Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns $2,200 each pay period. In  a year, the employee gets paid 26 times. Write a program that defines the following  variables:  

pay Amount      This variable will bold the amount of pay the employee earns each  pay period. Initialize the variable with 2200.0. 
payPeriods      This variable will hold the number of pay periods in a year. Initialize  the variable with 26.
annual Pay      This variable will hold the employee's total annaul pay, which will  be calculated.

The program should calculate the employee's total annual pay by multiplying the  employee's pay amount by the number of pay periods in a year and store the result in  che annual Pay variable. Display the total annual pay on the screen.  

7. Ocean Levels  
Assuming the ocean's level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write  a program that displays:  

• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will  be in 5 years.  
• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will  be in 7 years.  
• The number of millimeters higher than the current level that the ocean's level will  be in 10 years.  

8. Total Purchase  
A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the five items are as follows:  

Price of item 1 = $15.95  
Price of item 2 = $24.95  
Price of item 3 = $6.95  
Price of item 4 = $12.95  
Price of item 5 = $3.95 

Write a program that holds the prices of the five items io five variables. Display each  item's price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total. Assume the  sales tax is 7 percent.  

9. Cyborg Data Type Sizes  
You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In order to  accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the following data  types use: char, int, float, and double. You do not have any technical documentation, so you can't look this information up. Write a C++ program that will determine  the amount of memory used by these types and display the information on the screen.  

10. Miles per Gallon  
A car holds 15 gallons of gasoline and can travel 375 miles before refueling. Write a  program that calculates the number of miles per gallon the car gets. Display the result  on the screen.  
Hint: Use the following formula to calculate miles per gallon (MPG):  
MPG = Miles Driven/Gallons of Gas Used  

11. Distance per T ank of Gas  A car with a 20-gallon gas tank averages 23.5 miles per gallon when driven in town,  and 28.9 miles per gallon when driven on the highway. Write a program that calculates  and displays the distance the car can travel on one rank of gas when driven in town  and when driven on the highway.  Hint: The following formula can be used co calculate the distance:  Distance = N umber of Gallons X Average Miles per Gallon  


12. Land Calculation  One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that calculates  the number of acres in a tract of land with 391 ,876 square feet.  

13. Circuit Board Price  An electronics company sells circuit boards at a 35 percent profit. Write a program th at  will calculate the selling price of a circuit board that costs $14.95. Display the result  on the screen.  

14. Personal Information  Write a program that displays the following pieces of information, each on a separate line:  Your name  Your address, with city, state, and ZIP code  Your telephone number  Your college major  Use only a single cout statement to display all of this information.  

15. Triangle Pattern  Write a program that displays rhe following pattern on the screen: 

16. Diamond Pattern  Write a program that displays the following pattern: 
 
17. Stock Commission  Kathryn bought 750 shares of stock at a price of $35.00 per share. She must pay her  stockbroker a 2 percent commission for the transaction. Write a program that calculates and displays the following:  
• The amount paid for the stock alone (without the commission).  
• The amount of the commission.  
• The total amount paid (for the stock plus the commission).  

18. Energy Drink Consumption  A soft drink company recently surveyed 16,500 of its customers and found that approximately 15 percent of those surveyed purchase one or more energy drinks per week. Of  those customers who purchase energy drinks, approximately 58 percent of them prefer  cirrus-flavored energy drinks. Write a program that displays rhe following:  
• The approximate number of customers in the survey who purchase one or more  energy drinks per week.  
• The approximate number of customers in the survey who prefer citrus-flavored  energy drinks.  

19. Annual High Temperatures  The average July high temperarure is 85 degrees Fahrenheit in New York City, 88 degrees  Fahrenheit in Denver, and 106 degrees Fahrenheit in Phoenix. Write a program that  calculates and reports what the new average July high temperature would be for each of  these cities if temperatures rise by 2 percent.  

20. How Much Paint  A particular brand of paint covers 340 square feet per gallon. Write a program to  determine and report approximately how many gallons of paint will be needed to paint  two coats on a wooden fence that is 6 feet high and 100 feet long.
